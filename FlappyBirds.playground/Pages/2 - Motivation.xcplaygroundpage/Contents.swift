 ## 1. Motivation
 
 ### 🤔 What do I want to take out of this project?
 
 Beyond the chance to be part of the WWDC — _which would be really awesome_ — I wanted to take something away for myself.
 This is why I chose to do something I had never done before.
 Looking at the WWDC Scholarship homepage I thought "_What better way to showcase creativity than to create a **game?**_".

 Creating a game would require me to learn or improve several skills — conceptualizing the game itself, visual and audio design as well as getting to know _SpriteKit_ and the Playground environment.
 All of this in a little more than 2 weeks.
 Perfect!

 ### 🐣 Why Flappy Birds?
 
 You might ask why, build _Flappy Birds_ then?
 Several reasons!
 
 * The level of complexity seemed perfect for the available time and my experience.
 * The finished project would allow me to explain _SpriteKit_ essentials to friends interested in building their own games.
 * Designing the game assets (for multiple levels) would allow me to give the game a personal touch.
 * And — maybe most importantly — after asking friends which mobile games they loved (and hated) most over the years, *FlappyBird* was the one that popped up most often.
