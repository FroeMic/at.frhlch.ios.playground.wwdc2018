/*:
 **Goal:** My goal was to familiarize myself with *SpriteKit* and build an simple game.
 
 **Secondary Goals:**
 * Extensibility: Adding new levels should be easy
 * Clean Code: Expressive and easy to understand code
 * Transfer Value: The playground can be used to teach *SpriteKit* basics to other students
 
 **Description:** The resulting project shows a simple "Flappy-Bird" inspired game.
 Given the 3-minute limit, I think the playground is best experienced by playing.
 For further information on the code, have a look at the subsequent playground pages.

// ### How it started
// When I thought about what to build for my submission, two words words from the WWDC scholarship homepage kept coming back to be.
// **Creativtity** and **Student**.
// I wanted both of these aspects to be part of my project.
// Therefore, I decided to dive into a topic I had no prior experience with, a topic were the creating the submission would allow me to learn‚Äî Building a Mobile Game.

// ### Why *Flappy Bird* üê¶
// After asking friends which mobile they loved (and hated) since they had smartphones, *FlappyBird* was the one that popped up most often.
// Creating the animated assets would provide another challenge for me.
//
// Why Flappy Bird?
