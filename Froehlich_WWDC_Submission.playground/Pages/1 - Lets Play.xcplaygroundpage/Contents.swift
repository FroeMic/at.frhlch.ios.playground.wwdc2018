//: # Hello WWDC üëã
/*:
 ### ‚è∞ 3 minutes is not a lot of time, so let's cut right to it.
 My name is *Michael* and I would love to be part of this year's WWDC. To show you, I built this playground featuring my first-ever game, inspired by the 2013 classic [Flappy Bird](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird).

 
üëâ I think the game is best experienced by playing.
 Just select a level and open the _Live View_ in the _Assistant Editor_. (üîà make sure to have sound turned on)
 
üëâ After playing, have a look at the following pages with advanced [Examples](1.1%20Custom%20Level) how to create your own levels and the [Write-Up](2%20-%20Motivation), where I highlight my design goals, software engineering aspects and challenges I had to face during development.
